## Netflix OSS Plugins (Rob Spieldenner)

Netflix has open sourced many of our Gradle plugins under the name Nebula. These plugins are there to lend our expertise
and experience to building responsible projects, internally and externally. This talk will cover some of the ones we’ve
published, why we want to share these with the community, how we tested and published them, and most importantly how you
can contribute back to them.

Nebula started off as a set of strong opinions to make Gradle simple to use for our developers. But we quickly learned 
that we could use the same assumptions on our open source projects and on other Gradle plugins to make them easy to 
build, test, and deploy. By standardizing plugin development, we’ve lowered the barrier to generating them, allowing us 
to keep our build modular and composable.
