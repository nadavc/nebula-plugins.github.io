## Nebula, an overview (Justin Ryan)

Netflix has open sourced many of our Gradle plugins under the name Nebula. These plugins are there to lend our expertise and experience to building responsible projects, internally and externally. This talk will cover some of the ones we've published, why we want to share these with the community, how we tested and published them, and most importantly how you can contribute back to them.

Nebula started off as a set of strong opinions to make Gradle simple to use for our developers. But we quickly learned that we could use the same assumptions on our open source projects and on other Gradle plugins to make them easy to build, test and deploy. By standardizing plugin development, we've lowered the barrier to generating them, allowing us to keep our build modular and composable.
