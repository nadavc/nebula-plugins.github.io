### Repeatable builds

Going back to a previous commit of your code and building it from source doesnâ€™t guarantee exactly the same result. Your transitive dependency graph can change in subtle ways, even if you are careful to pin your dependencies. Nebula can help you lock your resolved dependency graph into source control quickly and easily.
